# Medical Image Segmentation: Project
Code base for the Medical Image Segmentation on 12 abdominal organs. U-net model is been trained and got DSC: 0.64 and NSC: 0.5176

<h2>Optimizations</h2> 

- Class Imbalance: Dice Loss should handle. 
- Train Images are Noisy: Can change the loss funcation that is robust to handle noise (like Tversky loss)
